Rate of Force Development 
-------------------------------------------------

A project to determine the Rate of Force Development (RoFD) among individuals
who had tested their physical strength against sensors.

The goal of this project is to answer two questions:
1) The time it takes to reach X% peak per repetition cycle
2) Time to reach Y% peak for all cycles

-------------------------------------------------

For each data set, output of this program should be a table like such:

Repetition #  |  Time to Peak  |  Force  | RoFD (dF/dT)
1                100ms            2.4      ...
2                300ms            4.5      ...

For each data set, output of this program should also show (similar data):

Repetition #  |  Time to %X Peak  |  Force by %X peak  |  RoFD (dF/dT over %X)
...              ...                 ...                  ...
